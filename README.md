### Goal

The goal of this project was to create an link shortening API, and monitor the amount of visits.
The API is public and entries are periodically reset/removed.



### Users should be able to:

  

 - Add a URL to be shortened
 - See a list of shortened URLs on the homepage
 - See how many times a shortened link has been visited
 - Copy the link with one click
 - Click a link and get redirected to the original URL
 - URLs are periodically deleted
